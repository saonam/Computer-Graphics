Title:
Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) - Line Generation Algorithm

Theory:
In any 2-Dimensional plane if we connect two points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1), we get a line segment. But in the case of computer graphics we can not directly join any two coordinate points, for that we should calculate intermediate pointâ€™s coordinate and put a pixel for each intermediate point, of the desired color with help of functions like putpixel(x, y, K) in C, where (x,y) is our co-ordinate and K denotes some color.
Examples:
Input: For line segment between (2, 2) and (6, 6) :
we need (3, 3) (4, 4) and (5, 5) as our intermediate
points.
Input: For line segment between (0, 2) and (0, 6) :
we need (0, 3) (0, 4) and (0, 5) as our intermediate
points.

Algorithm:
step 1: Get one point as (X0, Y0) and second point of line as (X1, Y1) 
step 2: Calculate difference between two end points
dx = X1 - X0
dy = Y1 - Y0
step 3: calculate the number of steps to put pixel
steps = abs(dx) > abs(dy) ? abs(dx) : abs(dy)
step 4: calculate the increment in x and y axis
Xinc = dx / steps
Yinc = dy / steps
step 5: put the pixel in each coordinates
X, Y = X0, Y0
for (i=0; i<=steps; i++)
{
    putpixel(X,Y, white)
    X += Xinc
    Y += Yinc
}
